			<h1> About my friends </h1>
			<p> I genuinely love and adore all of my friends for more than just who they are, but 
                who they were before and who they will be in the future. I believe that every single one of them
                will do amazing things and I'm always so proud of them, no matter the outcome. They are some of the 
                most hardworking, kind, and funny people I know. I hope that every single one of them makes their dreams
                come true because I truly believe that they deserve the best in life. I would not change the way that 
                things are now for anything in the world. Every single one of them has had such an impact on who I am
                and how I act every day in my life. They've all shaped the person that I am today and I could 
                never express how thankful I am to have them in my life every day. I could not imagine a reality 
                without them, even if I wanted to. I hope that they all continue to grow and thrive. You too. I hope that 
                anyone who reads this grows and thrives and becomes a wonderful person, not by my standards, but someone 
                that you can be proud of.
