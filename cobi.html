			<h1> Cobi </h1>
			<p> Cobi is definitely one of the most interesting people I know. While 
				still being able to take a joke, he's also one of the more intelligent friends I have. 
				Although I haven't known him long and he hasn't even been in Canada for very long, it 
				feels like I have known him for most of my life.
