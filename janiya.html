			<h1> Janiya </h1>
			<p> Janiya is one of the prettiest and silliest girls I know. She's an absolute sweetheart with
				her roblox addiction and interesting self-held events. She's taught me so much about how little
				everything matters in the grand scheme of things and she's helped me enjoy the smaller things 
				in life like no one else could ever. She can make light of any dark situation while still being
				able to make the people around her laugh all the time. I hope everyone has a Janiya in their lives. 
			</p>
